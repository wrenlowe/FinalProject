# FinalProject

# To Do:

• Make the icon for the app -> make it a calendar icon

• Model for the app -> stores the information stored on the app

• At least 3 views; at least 2 views should "use" the same data (either sharing or
passing the data); persistent meaningful data.

    • Main Activity -> starting display?
    • Data Activity -> calendar display?
    • Third Activity -> to-do list display?
    
• At least 2 transitions between screens.

    • transition from Main Activity to Data Activity
    • transition from Main Activity to Third Activity
    
• Includes meaningful use of either an app (for example, email, voice recognition,
..) or hardware (gps, accelerometer, ..) from the phone or some Google services(
maps, ..). -> could use the built in calendar app

• Uses at least two new GUI components not studied in class (rating bar, seek bar,
progress bar, analog clock, calendar view, ...). 

    • calendar view? https://abhiandroid.com/ui/calendarview#gsc.tab=0 
    • progress bar, to show how many tasks they completed that day?
    
• There should be a listener registered on at least one of these 2 new GUI
components (and there should be code to do something meaningful).

    • one on the calendar view? setOnDateChangeListener(OnDateChangeListenerlistener)
    • some handler on progress bar?
    
• Includes advertising (fake ad pulled from Google services).
